! At the moment we support only ox_target but in the close future we are going to support ox_target, qtarget, qb-target and bt-target. About the zones we currently support ox_lib but when we finish the resource there will be an update which will add support for bt-polyzone and distance checking. At the moment we support only the ox_lib context/input dialong menu but we are planning to add qb-menu&qb-input, nh-context&nh-keyboard, zf-context&zf-dialog.
